[{"body":"Command \u0026amp; Conquer Remastered for Vortex (CnCRV) is an unofficial extension for the Vortex mod manager that adds support for installing and managing Command and Conquer Remastered mods in Vortex, just like any other supported title. To clarify, this project is not affiliated in any way with Nexus Mods, Petroglyph Games or anyone else, and is an open-source community resource.\nStatus and Limitations CnCRV is still beta-quality software! While I can test locally, I won't be able to cover every case and there is a high potential for bugs that haven't been found yet, especially with how new the modding scene for C\u0026amp;C Remastered is. The following is definitely supported at this point:\n Installing mods: Installing mods or tweaks from archive files works, deploying directly to your user mods directory. Managing mods: The standard Vortex install/enable/disable/uninstall operations should all work just as they do for any other Vortex-managed game. Profiles: Create multiple profiles for different sets of mods or tweaks and quickly switch between them. Automatic Game Detection: The extension should automatically detect which game your mod is for during installation, deploying it to the right mod path.  There's some features that we've included to get them in your hands as fast as possible, but might still have some rough edges:\n Support for INI tweaks: You're currently able to install INI tweaks (i.e. mods that are just one or more .ini files), but this hasn't been fully tested. There's also no support for merging multiple tweaks.   If you're really missing specific features you can open an issue and we can discuss the viability, or find me on the Nexus Mods Discord.\n Nexus Mods To be clear and upfront: being supported in Vortex (using CnCRV) does not mean that the Nexus Mods or Vortex team officially supports this extension or any mods you install using it. See the FAQ for extra details.\nThe Nexus team has, however, enabled Vortex integration on Nexus Mods for C\u0026amp;C so once you have the extension installed you can use the Vortex buttons on the site to quickly install mods.\n","excerpt":"Command \u0026amp; Conquer Remastered for Vortex (CnCRV) is an unofficial extension for the Vortex mod …","ref":"/docs/introduction/","title":"Introduction"},{"body":"","excerpt":"","ref":"/blog/releases/","title":"Releases"},{"body":" This site includes only the guides for getting started with CnCRV and managing C\u0026amp;C Remastered mods with Vortex. For help with Vortex, check out the Vortex Support page.\n Welcome to the User Guide for the C\u0026amp;C Remastered for Vortex project! Navigate the documentation using the links on the sidebar.\nDocumentation for how to get started with the extension, as well as how to manage your mods is available. Remember, these docs are also open-source and contributions are always welcome!\n","excerpt":"This site includes only the guides for getting started with CnCRV and managing C\u0026amp;C Remastered …","ref":"/docs/","title":"Documentation"},{"body":"Below is a collection of frequent questions and the best answers I can give.\nWhy do I need Vortex for this? You don't! If you prefer installing and managing your mods manually, or using any other modding tools, I recommend using them! CnCRV is just an alternate method of installing mods for those who are more familiar with Vortex already.\nI’m a mod/pack author, how do I make mods compatible with Vortex? They probably already are! If you want to maximise support and avoid some issues, pack your mod archive in such a way that the root of the archive should end up at the root of the user's Mods directory, and that’s basically it.\nThe installer will auto-detect your mods ccmod.json and ignore anything above it, so feel free to lay out your archive how you like as long as that file is in the right place.\nMy mod got installed for the wrong game! How do I fix it? The installer relies on finding a RedAlert.dll or TiberianDawn.dll file to determine which game to install for. If that doesn't work, or the installer picks the wrong game, open the mod details pane (double click in the Mods list) and change the Mod Type to the correct game. Run a Deploy and the mod should end up in the right place.\nWhat about mods that aren't on the Nexus? They should still work fine! As long as they have a ccmod.json file, Vortex can try and install it anyway. Remember that non-Nexus mods won't have quite the same metadata available in Vortex you might be used to.\n","excerpt":"Below is a collection of frequent questions and the best answers I can give.\nWhy do I need Vortex …","ref":"/docs/introduction/faq/","title":"Frequently Asked Questions"},{"body":"Quick Start The fastest way to get started is to just open the Games page in Vortex and scroll down through the unmanaged games. You should see an entry for C\u0026amp;C Remastered Collection in there. Click Manage on that entry and follow the prompts to install the extension and restart Vortex. You should be good to go and try installing some mods!\nInstalling the Extension If the quick start doesn't work or you want to install the extension yourself, there's a couple of different ways to do that! Unless you've got a pretty specific use case, you'll probably want one of the two automatic methods, but manual installation is available as well.\nAutomatic Installation  This is the easiest way to install!\n  Open up Vortex, and open the Extensions panel from the left sidebar. Click Find more to open the list of Extensions Find Command and Conquer Remastered Support and click Install Wait for the extension to install and restart Vortex when prompted.  Once Vortex has restarted, just click the Manage button on C\u0026amp;C Remastered in your Games screen and you're ready to install some mods!\nSemi-Automatic Installation If you can't install directly from the Extensions screen, you can instead install from the archive.\n Download the archive from Nexus Mods or GitHub Open the Extensions panel in Vortex Click on the Drop File(s) box in the corner and locate the archive you downloaded. Wait for the extension to install and restart Vortex when prompted.  Once Vortex has restarted, just click the Manage button on C\u0026amp;C Remastered in your Games screen and you're ready to install some mods!\nManual Installation  Only attempt this if you absolutely have to. It becomes much harder to debug and much harder to upgrade.\n If you want to install the extension yourself, you will have to install the actual extension files manually. Make sure you close Vortex before proceeding.\nFirst, download the archive from Nexus Mods or GitHub.\nNext, unpack the archive to somewhere convenient. You should have a directory named game-cncremastered with four files inside:\n info.json index.js gameart.png  Now, copy the whole directory to your Vortex folder. You can easily open your Vortex folder by opening a new File Explorer window and entering the following in to the location bar: %APPDATA%/Vortex and then opening the plugins directory (create it if it doesn’t exist).\nOnce you’re done, you should have four files at the following locations:\nC:\\Users\\\u0026lt;your-user-name-here\u0026gt;\\AppData\\Roaming\\Vortex\\plugins\\game-cncremastered\\info.json C:\\Users\\\u0026lt;your-user-name-here\u0026gt;\\AppData\\Roaming\\Vortex\\plugins\\game-cncremastered\\index.js C:\\Users\\\u0026lt;your-user-name-here\u0026gt;\\AppData\\Roaming\\Vortex\\plugins\\game-cncremastered\\gameart.png With those files in place, you're clear to start Vortex and you should see the C\u0026amp;C Remastered icon in the Games screen light up.\n","excerpt":"Quick Start The fastest way to get started is to just open the Games page in Vortex and scroll down …","ref":"/docs/usage/installation/","title":"Installation"},{"body":"At it's core, installing mods is roughly the same as any Vortex-enabled game, once you've added C\u0026amp;C Remastered as a managed game in Vortex.\nIf you haven't already, open the Games screen and click the Manage button on the C\u0026amp;C Remastered icon under Unmanaged\n  Remember that mods still need to be enabled in-game from the Options ▶ Mods menu!\n Installing from Nexus Mods If you're installing mods from Nexus Mods, you can use the \u0026ldquo;Vortex\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;Download with Mod Manager\u0026rdquo; buttons on the mod page to automatically open Vortex and download the mod. Simply Install and Enable like usual and you should be good to go.\nInstall from archives You can also download mod archives directly from Nexus Mods or anywhere else you like and install them with Vortex. Simply use the Install From File button in the toolbar or drop them onto the drop zone at the bottom of the Vortex window.\n Be aware that installing from non-Nexus archives will often not include the full metadata. You can double-click the mod in the mod list to change its details.\n Please note that \u0026ldquo;raw\u0026rdquo; mods that aren't packaged in an archive (for example, loose ini files) aren't supported, but Vortex should offer to create an archive for you if you try and install them.\n","excerpt":"At it's core, installing mods is roughly the same as any Vortex-enabled game, once you've added …","ref":"/docs/usage/mods/","title":"Installing Mods"},{"body":" This site includes only the guides for getting started with the extension and managing C\u0026amp;C Remastered mods with Vortex.
