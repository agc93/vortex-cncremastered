# C&C Remastered Collection support for Vortex

This extension adds support for C&C Remastered mods to the Vortex mod manager.

**Important**: This extension has not been tested *at all* with the Origin version of C&C Remastered. If you own the Origin version and can help me out with a few questions, please find me on the Nexus Mods Discord or raise an issue here.

> This extension is still in preview, please report any issues you find! 

## What is it?

This is a simple Vortex extension that adds support for C&C Remastered mods so that you can install game mods using the Vortex mod manager.

Using Vortex, you can install, manage, track and uninstall mods for C&C Remastered Collection just like you install mod archives for any of the other Vortex-supported games.

## How to use it?

You can install the extension either from the CI builds (click the Actions tab above), or by installing it directly from Vortex's Extensions pane. Restart Vortex and you should be good to go.

You can then install mods from the Mods screen and Vortex should handle the rest. The extension will try and auto-detect which game the mod is for, but you can override this using the "Mod Type" dropdown from the mod details panel. Mods are automatically installed into their own folder under `~/Documents/CnCRemastered/Mods/<game>`. Remember that you still have to **enable mods in-game** from the Options menu before they will take effect.

> Please report any bugs or issues you find as I have only been able to complete some basic (and limited) testing with this extension.
