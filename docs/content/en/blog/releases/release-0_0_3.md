This release is a minor bugfix to [the previous alpha](/updates/v0.0.2) of the C&C Remastered extension! I've changed how we launch the game so it won't skip the game selection screen, or any of the other weird behaviour that was causing. Thanks @BigBizkit for reporting this one!

At this time we **only support the Steam** version of the game automatically. If you own the Origin version and can help me out with a few questions, please find me on the Nexus Mods Discord or raise an issue here.

You should be able to install mods for both Tiberian Dawn and Red Alert from archives in this release and use all the basic Vortex features of install/enable/disable/deploy/purge.
