This release is the first alpha of the C&C Remastered extension!

At this time we **only support the Steam** version of the game automatically. If you own the Origin version and can help me out with a few questions, please find me on the Nexus Mods Discord or raise an issue here.

You should be able to install mods for both Tiberian Dawn and Red Alert from archives in this release and support the basic Vortex features of install/enable/disable/deploy/purge.
