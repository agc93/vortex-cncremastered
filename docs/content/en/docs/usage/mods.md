  How to install, view and manage your mods in Vortex.
---

At it's core, installing mods is roughly the same as any Vortex-enabled game, once you've added C&C Remastered as a managed game in Vortex.

If you haven't already, open the Games screen and click the **Manage** button on the C&C Remastered icon under *Unmanaged*

Installing mods from archives is the easiest way (at current) to install mods for your C&C Remastered games.

> In future, Nexus Mods might enable the "Download with Vortex" buttons for C&C Remastered but for now, just download the mods manually.

## Install from archives

You can also download mod archives directly from Nexus Mods or anywhere else you like and install them with Vortex. Simply use the *Install From File* button in the toolbar or drop them onto the drop zone at the bottom of the Vortex window.

> Be aware that installing from non-Nexus archives will often not include the full metadata. You can double-click the mod in the mod list to change its details.

Please note that "raw" mods that aren't packaged in an archive (for example, loose `ini` files) aren't supported, but Vortex should offer to create an archive for you if you try and install them.
